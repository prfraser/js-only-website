# Building a website with JS

Using only JavaScript, create this landing page (http://i67.tinypic.com/okue6q.jpg). We've created the first element for you. Implement your styles through JavaScript as well.

- You'll find the dev tools inspector handy.
- Background image is included in the repo.
- Use this font: https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat
- When your script starts growing, move it to it's own 'app.js' file.
